Criteria A Planning
======================


Definition of a problem
--------------------------
Client is Yu, student from UWC ISAK Japan. He is leader of the gym club. He wants a system which will be cabpable of  Keeping track of students who are coming to the Kazakoshi gym, and keeping track of what are they doing there.
The first problem he is facing right now is that every time school bus takes students to Kazakoshi gym, he needs to manualy wirte down in a spreadsheet who from students came and who didn't. To avoid this unnecessary waste of time, he wants a website, where every student will be able to check in individualy with their phone. "I think having an overview of everyone who came or not on what day"
For that my application would reqire:
* Induvidualized log in capatibility for each club member
* Simple and intuative design
* A way of showing monthly and yearly summary for the club leader (Dates and times for evey check in of every member)

The second problem he is facing students signing up for gym club and spending 300yen of budget money for gym visit to run on a treadmills. Students can run outside which is for free and it doesn't uses up club budget. For that reason he wants me to come up with a way off keeping track what are students doing in a gym. "and  what they did in the gym so we know theyâ€™re actually using the gym"
